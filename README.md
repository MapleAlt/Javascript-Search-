Javascript search is a simple restriction free search engine! Use this how ever you like yet do not get caught. just copy and paste the code in a bookmark and follow the instructions when you run it. If you want to use it on the same tab over 1 time you might have to refresh. If you get in trouble it is not my problem! This is still in beta so dont expect much.
