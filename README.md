A simple javascript search engine
This is one of the most simple engines. You must search up something random on google then use the bookmarklet. It does not unblock or mess with any features of google besides redirected you to a new tab with your search query. You may modify the code for it but if you do please credit me. If you do something bad with the code by modifying I am not responsible for your actions. Please use the engine respectfully and remember everything you search you goes to your history. You do not need the rules.html but it is there to look over. YOUR MUST NOT COPY THE COMMENTS FOR IT TO WORK!
